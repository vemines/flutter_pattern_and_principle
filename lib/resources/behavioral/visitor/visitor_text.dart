  "Visitor Interface: ":
      "Defines a protocol for visitor objects, specifying methods for visiting different concrete element types.",
  "Concrete Visitor Classes: ":

  "Element Interface (Optional): ":
      "An optional interface that can be implemented by elements to provide a common way to accept visitors."

  "Double Dispatch: ":
      "Achieving a form of double dispatch where the specific behavior depends on both the visitor object and the element type being visited.",
  "Adding New Operations: ":
      "Adding new operations to the system without modifying existing element classes. New visitor classes can be created for the new operations.",

      "Visitor objects can be reused to perform different operations on the same element structure."
